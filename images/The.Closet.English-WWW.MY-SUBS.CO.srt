You tell me that you're
still looking for one,

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,635
but why should
I believe you? Huh?

11
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:27,042
I told you, I don't care what it
costs... Just get it done.

12
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:31,013
And I also told you,
my job depends on it...

13
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,818
Can you please try harder?

14
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:52,034
Ina, you're going to like
our new house.

00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,603
It's really quiet and there's
so much fresh air...

00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,973
The doctor said that it's
perfect for you.

17
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:59,307
It'll do you good...

18
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:03,912
Once you you get used to it,
I'm sure you'll like it. Hm?

19
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:12,620
Sweetie, did you know that...

20
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,722
that new doll
is a limited edition?

21
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,191
It was really hard to find.

Sweetheart.

28

You can't just run away.

29
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,252
I was looking
everywhere for you.

30
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:05,333
Ina, that's our new home.

00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:40,495
The new project, is, you know.
I'm just buried in work.

35
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:43,797
Do you even know what
you gave her for her birthday?

36
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:45,467
This necklace...

37
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,970
She wears it every day
since I told her it's from you.

38
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,840
Watch out!

will continues

<i>There's been no improvement?</i>

46
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,082
<i>She won't even
look me in the eye anymore.</i>

47
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,118
<i>The new environment and some
fresh air will do her good.</i>

48
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:39,321
<i>That's the reason
you moved out there.</i>

49
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:42,324
I, I don't know what else
to do for her...

50
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,525
It's very frustrating.

<i>As a last resort, you,</i>

52
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,595
<i>you could send her to that
Arts Camp I mentioned,</i>

53
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,998
<i>but you two
would be separated.</i>

54
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,534
<i>I'm not sure that it's
the best idea right now.</i>

55
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,203
<i>The truth is,
you need treatment.</i>

56
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,604
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

57
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,973
I'm more concerned about her.

58
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,176
<i>So, what are you doing?</i>

59
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,011
<i>Are you having fun playing?</i>

60
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,514
<i>Look, Daddy.
Look how fast I am!</i>

61
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:10,151
<i>Well, show me!
I'm excited to see you run!</i>

62
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,858
What? Just a minute.

63
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,127
Wasn't that all supposed
to be my job...

64
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,528
from start to finish?

65
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,597
<i>But you're never here.</i>

66
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,599
It's not because
I don't want to.

67
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,634
It's because of the kid!

68
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:30,038
Now you listen to me...
we signed a contract, you know?

69
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:31,539
Or am I wrong?

70
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:35,910
Okay, I'll come by...
I'll see you at the site.

71

<i>and you smell like one, too!</i>

75
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,988
<i>Whoo!</i>

76
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:50,158
<i>Blow out the candles!
Or shall I do it?</i>

77
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,659
<i>No way!</i>

78
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,366

- <i>IT's a secret!</i>

- <i>Aren't you going to tell me?</i>
- <i>No!</i>

80
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,351
Ina!

81
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:04,692
What's wrong, honey?

82
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,161
Why did you scream just now?

83
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:09,264
I didn't scream, Daddy.

84
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,400
Is everything okay?

85
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,535
Uh-huh.

86
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,441
Can I come in for a while?

87
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,476
Yeah.

88
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:28,182
That's strange.

89
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,351
Are you sure you didn't scream?

90
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,486
Uh-huh.

91
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:45,133
Ina, where did you
get that doll?

92
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,135
It was in here.

93
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,070
- In there?
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,272
Let me see.

95
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:00,448
Do you remember?

96
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,717
I bought you a new doll
the other day?

97
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,520
I think you'll have more fun
playing with her.

98
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:08,256
Papa, can I also keep
this one?

99
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,291
It's dirty and belongs
to someone else.

100
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:12,493
Give it to me,
I'll throw it out.

101
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,696
I want to play
with both dolls.

102
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,564
That would be so much fun.

103
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,172
Are you really okay?

104
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,206
Mm-hmm.

105
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:28,142
Alright.

106
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,511
Time for bed.

107
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,881
Okay.

108
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:12,955
That was delicious.

109
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:16,424
Papa, can I go play
in my room now?

110
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,826
If you'd like.

111
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,276
I live our new house.

112
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,379
I even found a few friend.

113
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,417
That's great, Ina.
Great.

114
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,865
<i>Why is Hyun-Sang
at the meeting?</i>

115
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:58,366
If we both design it,

116
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,235
the whole concept will go
out the window. Huh?

117
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:03,806
What does he know
about art galleries?

118
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,340
He's never even designed
a little shack.

119
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:10,278
While you were away,
he did a gallery in Jeju.

120
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,780
He's hungry,
just like you used to be.

121
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,315
Honestly?

122
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,819
They really only wanted him.

123
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:19,253
I had to fight to get you
on this project.

124
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,656
That's bullshit.

125
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,026
The boss isn't happy either.

126
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,394
He says "No architect
can design anything,

127
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,795
if he's never seen
a building site.

128
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,697
I told you I'll be here.

129
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:32,467
But first, I have to find
a nanny for my daughter.

130
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,470
You've been saying that
for more than a month.

131
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:36,939
Time's running out.

132
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,810
Look over there.
Why is he here?

133
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,946
Huh... that's strange.

134
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:47,682
Why is Hyun-Sang here?
Could be coincidence.

135
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,486
So it's already been decided?
Huh?

136
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,422
No, why?

137
00:15:56,992 --> 00:16:00,762
I will get this project done.
But without him.

138
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,231
Huh?

139
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:04,632
They have to choose between
me or him.

140
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,507
<i>Wait...</i>

141
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,612
<i>Hold on.</i>

142
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,120
Ina, what were you doing?

143
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,889
I wrote a song
as a surprise for you.

144
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,691
Do you want to hear it?

145
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:07,662
Ina.

146
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:11,632
I have to tell you something...

147
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,805
Remember, I told you about
designing a museum in Tongyeong?

148
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,141
Construction is starting
very soon.

149
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:22,610
That means I've got to spend
more time at the building site.

150
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:27,448
That's why I have hired a nanny
to take care of you. Okay?

151
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:30,953
- How long will it be, Dad?
- Maybe two months.

152
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:33,822
But I'll be home
every weekend to be with you.

153
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:36,624
Can I come along with you,
Daddy?

154
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,095
You know that I would love
to have you with me.

155
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:43,031
Construction sites are not
really good for kids...

156
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:44,765
I hope you understand.

157
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,136
If you help me out
and stay here,

158
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,538
I'll buy you a present.
Okay?

159
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,408
If you do what
you want anyway,

160
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,744
why did you ask?

161
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:02,985
Sweetheart,

162
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:07,421
I'm not doing whatever I want...

163
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:10,893
We have to find a way
to work together on this.

164
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,729
But if you never like
anything I suggest,

165
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,032
then I don't know
what I should do.

166
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:23,771
Ina, please just try
to understand my situation.

167
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:27,943
You don't want to be alone.
Let me think about it.

168
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,577
Okay?

169
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:46,527
Ina...
We'll talk about it again, okay?

170
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,772
Ina, it's late.
Go to bed.

171
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:05,753
<i>Let me know by tomorrow
if you're coming or not.</i>

172
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:15,263
<i>What kind of therapy
does the art camp offer?</i>

173
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:17,966
<i>It starts with
Isolation Therapy.</i>

174
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,935
<i>How will she cope with that?</i>

175
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:22,270
<i>Separated from me,
and without her mother...</i>

176
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:26,041
<i>It won't be easy, but what
other choice do you have?</i>

177
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:28,009
<i>This is too much for you.</i>

178
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:31,446
<i>They only take a handful
of kids and expect a donation.</i>

179
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:33,982
<i>So, think about it.</i>

180
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,220
Where are you going?

181
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:44,292
Ina, I have to got to work.
I'll be right back.

182
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,328
You wanted to talk to me...

183
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:49,197
Haven't you found
a present for me yet?

184
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:51,933
Ina,

185
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,936
let's talk about it tonight.

186
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,340
I ordered that doll for you.
It's coming from New York.

187
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,175
It'll be here soon.

188
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:04,879
Do you know how old I am?

189
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:07,082
I don't need
all these stupid dolls.

190
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,950
Ina...

191
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,820
You said you liked that doll.

192
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,556
And why are you talking
to me like that?

193
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,757
Why are you telling me
what I like?

194
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:20,095
Then you should tell me
what you want.

195
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,065
Absolutely nothing...

196
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,069
- And you call yourself a "Dad".
- What?

197
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:29,304
Ina!

198
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:30,805
Don't!

199
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,275
Don't! Don't!

200
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:37,345
Don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't!

201
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:57,465
Hello. I believe you're
looking for a nanny?

202
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,470
Hello. Yes. You know,
I, I was just on my way out.

203
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:05,006
It's 150 dollars a day.

204
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:07,876
Okay.

205
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:20,588
Do-Hyun,
this Art Camp donation,

206
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:22,524
how much are we talking about?

207
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,535
They are very well off.

208
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,538
The girl is in her room.

209
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:41,009
No wife...

210
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:45,080
Who knows.
It's possible she left him.

211
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:48,883
Anyway, he hid
all the expensive stuff.

212
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,418
What I found
is exactly my style.

213
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,007
This is my colleague.

214
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,676
- Hello.
- Mr. Kim.

215
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,277
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

216
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,213
The pleasure is mine.

217
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:21,082
- Shall we go inside?
- Sure. Yes.

218
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:24,986
She won't stop screaming and
throwing shit around her room.

219
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,956
It doesn't matter what I cook.
She won't eat it.

220
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,426
She won't starve to death...

221
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,409
Shit!

222
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,912
You crazy little bitch!

223
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,647
She just started.

224
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,316
How can she quit
on her first day? Huh?

225
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,187
Don't give me that bullshit!

226
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,389
I'll be home this evening.

227
00:27:01,423 --> 00:27:03,324
Make sure she stays
until I get there!

228
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:04,225
She took the money.

229
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,095
Tell her she has to finish
out the day.

230
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:10,098
Impossible.
I cannot leave.

231
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,469
Okay.

232
00:27:16,204 --> 00:27:18,039
<i>I spoke wit the camp manager.</i>

233
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,974
<i>You can send her there
next week!</i>

234
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,541
I want to go, too.

235
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,644
Take me with you!

236
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,423
<i>Come with us!
We'll take you away.</i>

237
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,391
<i>Come with us!
We'll take you away.</i>

238
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,694
<i>Come with us!
We'll take you away...</i>

239
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:13,628
<i>Come with us!</i>

240
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:15,997
<i>Come with us!
We'll take you away...</i>

241
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,308
<i>Child missing: Ina Yeon
(girl, 11 years old)</i>

242
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:05,480
Thank you all.

243
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:22,730
That's not her.

244
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:26,200
She's been missing
for more than a month.

245
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,303
And you've come up with nothing.

246
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,672
It's frustrating.

247
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,473
We're not getting anywhere.

248
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:34,475
That nanny I hired.

249
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,178
Ina disappeared
right after she left.

250
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,647
Perhaps you could
question her again?

251
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:42,784
Well, we checked her car's
dash-cam video from that day,

252
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:44,820
and even had her take
a lie detector test.

253
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:46,554
I'm telling you, she's clean.

254
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,489
Go home and wait.
We'll call you.

255
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:51,159
You keep telling me
to go home and wait,

256
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:52,627
are you investigating this case,
or not?!

257
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,797
I understand you're upset,
but we are on the case.

258
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,535
- Ready.
- Okay.

259
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:08,176
Mr. Yeon,

260
00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:10,278
please look into the camera.

261
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:14,282
Tell us about Ina.
Say whatever you'd like.

262
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,893
Hello, my name is
Sang-Won Yeon,

263
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:29,464
and this photo
is of my daughter, Ina.

264
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:31,766
She's 11 years old.

265
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,668
About a month ago...

266
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,505
Sh, she, she just disappeared.

267
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:43,678
I need your help to find her!
Please help!

268
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:47,415
<i>If you know anything,
please contact the police.</i>

269
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,818
<i>We have checked
every security camera</i>

270
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:53,956
<i>and vehicle dash-cam within
a two-mile radius of Ina's home.</i>

271
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:56,691
<i>We have found
no trace of her at all.</i>

272
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,429
<i>Her mother died in a tragic
car accident last year.</i>

273
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:03,798
<i>The girl lived with her father.</i>

274
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,566
<i>According to witnesses,</i>

275
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,369
<i>the two were not
getting along very well.</i>

276
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:10,939
<i>While we were filming
in the family home,</i>

277
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:14,709
<i>we stumbled upon
numerous prescription drugs.</i>

278
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,913
<i>These are prescribed for
psychological disorders,</i>

279
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:21,416
<i>which implicates the treatment
of a serious condition.</i>

280
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:23,418
<i>The amount of medications
would be indicative</i>

281
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:25,219
<i>of a wide range of symptoms.</i>

282
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,555
<i>Yeah.
He was so fixated on work,</i>

283
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:28,957
<i>I was starting to get worried.</i>

284
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:31,325
<i>He never took any time off.</i>

285
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,629
<i>That probably made him
nervous and anxious.</i>

286
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:38,666
<i>Sadly, when a child disappears
it is often linked to problems</i>

287
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,236
<i>within the family or issues
with certain family members.</i>

288
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,473
<i>You may recall our report on
the disappearance of Min-Jin,</i>

289
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:46,975
<i>three years ago.</i>

290
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:49,845
<i>Upon closer inspection,
there appear to be many</i>

291
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:53,681
<i>obvious similarities
between these two cases.</i>

292
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:57,618
<i>In neither of them have the
police made any real progress.</i>

293
00:31:57,652 --> 00:32:00,022
<i>Perhaps it is time to
re-examine these case</i>

294
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:01,756
<i>from a different angle.</i>

295
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,393
<i>A girl living with her father,
disappears from her home.</i>

296
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,930
<i>Where could she possibly be?</i>

297
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:11,232
<i>We are asking for information.</i>

298
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,872
Is this "Behind the Story"?

299
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:25,246
<i>Her father is a suspect.</i>

300
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:27,381
Tsk.

301
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,025
<i>No Internet Connection.</i>

302
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:46,567
<i>Ta-da!</i>

303
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,937
<i>Look!
A present from Daddy!</i>

304
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:51,539
<i>A butterfly necklace!</i>

305
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:53,608
<i>I love it!
It's so pretty!</i>

306
00:32:53,942 --> 00:32:55,743
<i>You really like it?</i>

307
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:57,745
<i>Do you want to say
thank you to Daddy?</i>

308
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,680
<i>Thank you, Daddy.</i>

309
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:31,405
Who are you?

310
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,042
Hello, sir.
I'm here for your internet.

311
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:35,878
Your front door was open.

312
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,412
Quite a big place
you've got here.

313
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:40,548
It'll take me a while
to find the problem.

314
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:45,720
Wow. This house is enormous.
Like a palace.

315
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:48,389
Are you an artist?

316
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:51,525
Or some kind of architect?

317
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,563
I would love to live
in a big house like this. Hmm.

318
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,833
But my family is poor.
Too bad.

319
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,434
It's not here.

320
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,470
How do you keep
this place clean? Huh?

321
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:05,908
This is too much for one person.
Do you have a cleaning lady?

322
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,944
It has a really high ceiling,
too.

323
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:11,679
I bet your heating bill
must be astronomical.

324
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:15,951
Did you know there are state
subsidies for solar panels etc.

325
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:18,086
It might be worth looking into.
You never know.

326
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,489
How much do you pay
per square foot here?

327
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:22,958
More than in Gangnam?

328
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:26,560
No idea.
You should ask a realtor that.

329
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:28,729
Can you just fix
the internet please?

330
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:31,465
Out here there are
cable problems.

331
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:32,200
That's nothing new.

332
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:35,569
So, the EMF is showing some...

333
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:49,952
I'm using an EMF detector
to find out what's going on.

334
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,122
EMF?
To check the internet?

335
00:35:55,924 --> 00:35:57,025
Do you mind?

336
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,827
Sure.

337
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,872
Ah-ha.

338
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:14,876
Sorry,

339
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:16,777
can I have your business card?

340
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:18,947
What do you need
a business car for now?

341
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:20,882
I'm almost there.

342
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:43,005
I checked on the router
on the side of your house.

343
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,273
Someone cut the cable.

344
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,009
Huh?
What'd you say?

345
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,978
Didn't you call
an internet technician?

346
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:55,817
Hold on. Wait a minute.
Don't be like that.

347
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,219
Let's talk.
I can explain!

348
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:58,920
Who the hell are you?

349
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:02,891
Don't get me wrong.

350
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,827
I had to see for myself.
I'm here to help you.

351
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:08,830
You're from that TV show?
I won't talk to them again.

352
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:11,033
I'm calling the police.

353
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,569
Before she vanished,
did Ina seem different?

354
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:19,107
Act strange. Talk to herself?
Scream in front of the closet?

355
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,311
How did you know that?

356
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:25,881
Because Ina isn't the first
to vanish.

357
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:28,316
Thirty-two kids
have disappeared since '98.

358
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,318
I've been looking for ten years.

359
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,223
Just "Google" me under
"Heo Exorcist".

360
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:39,593
There are internet
blogs about me.

361
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:41,096
<i>Professional Exorcism</i>
I, I've also been on TV.

362
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:44,598
<i>Exorcist Kyung-Hoon Heo</i>
I am Korea's number 1 exorcist.

363
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:48,003
My skills made my reputation,
which, then made my prices...

364
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,805
about here.

365
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:58,013
Here, take a look at this.

366
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:03,018
They all disappeared
from their homes,

367
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:06,154
while playing,
doing their homework,

368
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:07,788
while they were sleeping.

369
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:10,959
They all vanished
without a trace.

370
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:14,996
They made these drawings.

371
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,066
All of them are of a child.

372
00:38:23,238 --> 00:38:25,706
About 20 years ago,
a girl named Hyun-Soo

373
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,009
disappeared just like Ina.

374
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,077
Her parents conducted a ritual

375
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:31,980
to find out if their daughter
was still alive.

376
00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:10,352
You've seen her, right?
That's my mom.

377
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:15,257
Some of the other children's
parents mentioned

378
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,359
that they had seen her.

379
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:21,329
I think she was trying
to warn them,

380
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:23,165
to protect their children.

381
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,236
Shall I go on?

382
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:39,881
She killed my mother,
took the children.

383
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,983
Now, she has Ina as well.

384
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:44,085
That's her.

385
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,455
The source of all this,
a demonic child.

386
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:05,273
How can I believe you?
Huh?

387
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:07,275
Is this real? Huh?

388
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,743
A ghost stole my child?

389
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,846
You're ritual is a con.

390
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,481
You think I'm stupid?

391
00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:18,086
Get out!
Out!

392
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:29,397
So, you don't believe me.
Okay.

393
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:34,869
But I'm the only one
who believe you.

394
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:37,472
Everyone else thinks
you killed her.

395
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:40,041
If you don't hurry,

396
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:42,410
your daughter
will be lost forever.

397
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:51,152
Wait.

398
00:40:57,392 --> 00:40:59,494
Can you really find her?

399
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:04,866
Yeah.

400
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:10,872
Mourning someone lost

401
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:13,842
keeps their spirit in the
underworld for 49 days.

402
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,211
The so-called
49 Day Memorial Rite.

403
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:20,382
It's been explained in the
movie "Along With the Gods."

404
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:24,785
Haven't you seen it?

405
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:25,987
No, I haven't.

406
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,822
And I thought you had
an education.

407
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,193
In any case,
Ina's got only 3 days left.

408
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,361
No more.

409
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:37,432
Oh.

410
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:41,603
This sensor detects objects
that emit wavelengths

411
00:41:41,636 --> 00:41:43,938
far beyond quantum mechanics.

412
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:50,278
Basically, it detects ghosts.

413
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:58,286
So, where exactly is
Ina right now?

414
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,856
In the realm of the dead.

415
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:06,261
We call it the dark realm.

416
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:09,364
Uh-huh...

417
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,068
- Let me show you.
- Don't tear that.

418
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,216
Look here!

419
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:31,519
Here are the living.
Here are the dead.

420
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:35,290
Each has it's own realm.
This fold separates them.

421
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:37,592
They exist together,
side by side,

422
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,595
but because of this border,
they cannot see each other.

423
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:43,331
However, once their
respective frequencies

424
00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:44,999
start to synchronize,

425
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,535
they can see each other

426
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:50,605
and move between
the two realms.

427
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:53,108
Just like in "Interstellar".

428
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:55,076
A shamanic exorcism

429
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,012
disentangles those
two frequencies.

430
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:59,981
Some call it "Being possessed".

431
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:04,619
It happens a lot. Which is why
I have to protect myself.

432
00:43:12,227 --> 00:43:14,062
The most evil spirits

433
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:15,930
like the demon we're after,
<i>Synchronization</i>

434
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:18,500
find people that are
in sync with them,

435
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:21,169
and then pull them
into their realm.

436
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:24,172
With time,
they lose their memory

437
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:26,307
and they're only left
with evil.

438
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:28,576
They become the Blinded.

439
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,212
Once you look into their eyes,
you're trapped

440
00:43:31,246 --> 00:43:33,014
and get sucked
into their realm.

441
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:35,183
They're tortured souls.

442
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:47,128
What do I have to do
to find her?

443
00:43:47,362 --> 00:43:49,464
We just have to trap
the demon,

444
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:53,435
bargain or beat her,
whatever works.

445
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:02,377
<i>Demonic children
are attracted by dolls.</i>

446
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,547
<i>When they touch these straw
dolls soaked in my blood,</i>

447
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,115
<i>it excites them.</i>

448
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:09,517
<i>It's like a trap.</i>

449
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:12,654
Father of all,
we beseech you on behalf of Ina,

450
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:15,156
and for all those whom we love
but see no longer.

451
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,491
Grant to them eternal rest.

452
00:44:16,524 --> 00:44:18,393
Let your light
perpetually shine upon them.

453
00:44:18,426 --> 00:44:20,628
May her soul be rescued from
the souls of all the departed,

454
00:44:20,662 --> 00:44:22,263
through the mercy of God.

455
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,135
These charms create a boundary.

456
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:31,606
They're worth a fortune
and their value keeps going up.

457
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:36,578
Yep, they're really expensive.
Insanely expensive.

458
00:44:47,422 --> 00:44:50,725
So... Pay attention,
she'll be here soon.

459
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,160
Put this on.

460
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:28,696
Have you tried these noodles?

461
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:30,665
They taste home-made,

462
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:32,433
with fried tofu.

463
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:37,205
Who cares about fried tofu?
Does this really work?

464
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:38,807
Of course.

465
00:45:38,841 --> 00:45:41,442
Don't worry.
Just be patient.

466
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:48,449
Maybe she's on to us?
She hasn't come?

467
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:01,462
Wait... I hear something.

468
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:28,122
Oh, that's Ina's violin.

469
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:53,581
- Ow!
- Ah, my ears...

470
00:47:06,694 --> 00:47:08,162
Uh...

471
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:11,265
She has some nerve.

472
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,403
Was Ina here?

473
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:18,807
I'm not sure about that.

474
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:21,542
L... let's try it again,

475
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:24,212
I'll drench a big doll
with blood.

476
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:29,417
She is really something else.

477
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:51,506
Tell me...

478
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:55,743
Who's Ina's favorite singer?
BTS? Blackpink?

479
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:57,545
Some kid's band?

480
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,585
You don't know?

481
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:07,588
Who is her best friend?

482
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:12,995
I see.

483
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:15,229
You don't know much
about her, do you?

484
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:18,800
Do you ever talk to her?

485
00:48:21,302 --> 00:48:22,704
That's not good.

486
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:26,307
You know,
I really hate silence.

487
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,443
I also hate too much talk.

488
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,913
But I hate silence the most.

489
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,817
So, what would you
like me to call you?

490
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,618
Call me whatever you'd like.

491
00:48:37,785 --> 00:48:39,520
Mm.
How about...

492
00:48:40,521 --> 00:48:42,657
"Mr. Yeon."
What do you think?

493
00:48:43,025 --> 00:48:46,360
Or, since you hired me,
should I call you "Boss"?

494
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:49,998
I think I'd prefer "Mr. Yeon."

495
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:51,967
And what would you like me
to call you?

496
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,770
"Director."
They work the hardest.

497
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:00,809
I'm really thirsty!

498
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:02,510
I'll go check your fridge.

499
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,440
Director!

500
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:33,909

503

<i>Mr. Yeon, close your eyes!</i>

when your eyes are open.

507

So keep them shut and very
slowly get out of there!

508
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:42,905
Don't move now.

509

<i>Be very still.</i>

510
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:53,115
And now,
do exactly what I say!

511
00:51:55,683 --> 00:52:00,588
<i>Lie flat on the floor
and slowly turn to your right.</i>

512

Now go to the left!
Left!

513

<i>Mr. Yeon, stop!</i>

514
00:52:52,975 --> 00:52:54,176
Don't move a muscle.

515
00:52:56,211 --> 00:52:59,214
<i>Don't move!
Stay right there!</i>

516
00:53:04,552 --> 00:53:07,521
You're almost there.
Just hang on.

517
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,630
Shit.

518
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,767
Just stay still.
You mustn't move.

519
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,770
I'll be with you in a second!
Hang in there!

520
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,245

00:53:39,321 --> 00:53:41,023

Just this one.

Hmm.
It may be that Sangdong guy.

There's this guy living
on Mount Sangdong alone. Oh

00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,113
He has all this strange stuff

<i>Who are you?</i>

Sorry.
Are you Myung-Jin's father?

00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,376
Please leave!

566
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:04,045
Can I ask you some questions
about your daughter?

567
00:59:08,183 --> 00:59:09,451
Are you a cop?

568

No, I'm not.

569
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:31,039
My daughter,
she also disappeared.

570
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:33,908
I think Myung-Jin
had something to do with it.

571
00:59:37,245 --> 00:59:40,949
She disappeared
while she was asleep

572
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:42,917
in the room next to ours.

573

My wife went out to for her,
but she never returned.

574
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:53,561
I searched her for ten years,
then I gave up.

575
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,634
I spent the next ten years
trying to forget her.

576
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:02,971
And I have forgotten.

577
01:00:05,073 --> 01:00:06,474
Now leave.

578
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:11,146
Before she disappeared,
did something happen?

579
01:00:12,247 --> 01:00:16,050
It may sound strange,
but did her personality change?

580
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:19,320
Did she stand in front
of a closet and talk to herself?

581
01:00:20,622 --> 01:00:23,691
Why do you think I live alone
in the mountains?

582
01:00:27,028 --> 01:00:30,231
I don't want to be confronted
with children.

583
01:00:32,434 --> 01:00:35,970
That's why I live secluded
like a hermit.

584
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:38,373
I'm sorry.

585
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:48,550
Have you ever seen,
or recall this doll?

586
01:00:57,158 --> 01:00:58,593
Hey, hey!

587
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,066
How on Earth?
This is impossible.

588
01:01:08,236 --> 01:01:09,671
Why are you here?

01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,439
What do you want from me?

590
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:13,007
Stay away!

591
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:17,378
I don't want to die!

592
01:01:17,412 --> 01:01:20,281
You can't take me!
Never!

593
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:28,490

642
01:05:57,926 --> 01:05:59,627
<i>Please, Daddy!</i>

643
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,709
Exorcizamus te,
omnis immundus spiritus,

644
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:16,611
omnis satanica potestas,

645
01:06:16,644 --> 01:06:19,413
omnis incursio infernalis
adversarii,

646
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:22,985
omnis legio, omnis congregatio
et secta diabolica.

647
01:06:36,999 --> 01:06:38,332
Help me!

648
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:10,565
I saw Myung-Jin's death.

649
01:07:10,731 --> 01:07:13,534
Your frequencies
were synchronized.

650
01:07:13,902 --> 01:07:15,803
That's why you saw
her memories.

651
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,042
Her rage turned into a demon.

652
01:07:20,142 --> 01:07:23,711
She's gathered other kids,
that had suffered like she did.

653
01:07:25,147 --> 01:07:27,481
It makes sense,
if you think about it.

654
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:33,155
You've neglected Ina.

655
01:07:33,188 --> 01:07:34,122
Just be honest.

656
01:07:34,156 --> 01:07:37,125
Your work was always
more important to you.

657
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:41,629
Basically, you wanted her
to go away.

658
01:07:41,997 --> 01:07:43,698
Get to the point.

659
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:47,568
Children instinctively know

660
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:50,538
if someone truly loves them,
or not.

661
01:07:50,806 --> 01:07:53,942
Buying her a doll or a toy,
doesn't change that.

662
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,478
The missing kids
all share one thing:

663
01:07:58,113 --> 01:08:00,748
Their parents either physically

664
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:05,087
or emotionally abused
or neglected them.

665
01:08:06,088 --> 01:08:07,823
Just like with Ina.

666
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:11,592
How terrible it must have been
for her to live with a father,

667
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,495
who didn't want
to be with her.

668
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,632
Imagine how lonely she felt!

669
01:08:20,936 --> 01:08:25,107
Her soul cried out in pain,
and Myung-Jin heard her.

670
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:32,446
It's my fault she's gone.

671
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:05,546
- Mr. Heo.
- Hang on wait.

672
01:09:06,014 --> 01:09:07,481
Let me finish.

673
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:10,451
The frequency.

674
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:12,753
I see her
when we're in sync.

675
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:15,656
Does that mean
I can cross over to her?

676
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,992
Step into her realm?

677
01:09:17,192 --> 01:09:19,560
If you are in sync,
then yes.

678
01:09:19,828 --> 01:09:21,964
During my panic attack,

679
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:24,799
you said I was in sync
with Myung-Jin.

680
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:27,702
Does that mean
I can meet Ina?

681
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:30,504
What are you planning?

682
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:33,708
Let me cross over.
Our time is short.

683
01:09:35,243 --> 01:09:38,679
Absolutely not.
It's too dangerous.

684
01:09:38,713 --> 01:09:40,048
You could get killed.

685
01:09:43,185 --> 01:09:45,786
So what.
I don't care if it's dangerous.

686
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:49,257
We have no other choice.
Got a better idea?

687
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,962
Help me get to her!

688
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:56,865
You have no idea
what you're asking.

689
01:09:56,965 --> 01:09:59,567
You could lose your way
on the other side. Hmm?

690
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,837
This could destroy
my career as an exorcist.

691
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,106
What you're asking,
is impossible.

692
01:10:09,643 --> 01:10:11,980
Sorry for bringing up money,

693
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:14,749
but I will pay you
whatever you ask for.

694
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:18,253
I have to try.

695
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:22,224
I have to get to Ina before
she's completely out of time.

696
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:23,959
Help me get to her.

697
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:32,834
I will use the ritual
to protect you,

698
01:10:32,868 --> 01:10:34,936
but you'll only have
30 minutes.

699
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:36,204
If you don't get back...

700
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:38,672
Well, I don't need to tell you
about the Blinded.

701
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,675
You'll turn into one of them.

702
01:10:41,843 --> 01:10:43,945
I understand.
Let's try it.

703
01:10:45,613 --> 01:10:46,982
You're the boss.

704
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:50,252
<i>How can you trigger
a panic attack?</i>

705
01:10:50,285 --> 01:10:51,752
<i>It's a strange question.</i>

706
01:10:51,786 --> 01:10:54,089
You have to trust me.
Just tell me how.

707
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:55,257
I need to know.

708
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:16,211
<i>Myung-Jin Cho (11)</i>

709
01:11:28,824 --> 01:11:31,759
<i>A large dose of caffeine pills
can cause a panic attack,</i>

710
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,329
<i>and in a worst-case scenario,
death.</i>

711
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,032
<i>So be very careful.</i>

712
01:11:37,432 --> 01:11:39,234
<i>You've been warned.</i>

713
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:04,792
Are you ready?

714
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:07,795
They'll kick in
any minute now.

715
01:12:07,896 --> 01:12:09,797
You are stepping into
Myung-Jin's realm.

716
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:11,133
Anything could happen.

717
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:13,801
She'll do everything
in her power to stop you.

718
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:15,237
You must be aware of that.

719
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,907
Ina.
I'll bring her back with me.

720
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:23,812
Just stay alive,

721
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:28,049
so you can pay me
really well.

722
01:12:29,985 --> 01:12:31,652
Be worth it.

723
01:13:01,349 --> 01:13:03,318
This fire is linked
to your soul.

724
01:13:03,418 --> 01:13:05,253
When your time runs out,
or if you die,

725
01:13:05,287 --> 01:13:06,955
the fire will extinguish.

726
01:13:10,926 --> 01:13:13,261
Sicut déficit fumus defíciant;

727
01:13:13,295 --> 01:13:17,098
sicut fluit cera a fácia ígnis,
sic péreant peccatóres

728
01:13:17,132 --> 01:13:18,766
a fácia Dei.

729
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:55,537
<i>Give me the strength
o heaven,</i>

730
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:57,806
<i>to guide this soul through
the valley of death</i>

731
01:13:57,839 --> 01:14:00,408
<i>and return in peace to your
loving countenance.</i>

732
01:14:00,442 --> 01:14:01,843
<i>Prínceps gloriosíssine coeléstis

733
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,777
<i>sancte Míchael Archángele,</i>

734

Seung-Hee!

737
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,181
Wait!

738
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,121
Seung-Hee...

739
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:12,434
Look what you've done to Ina!

740
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:15,103
Ina is dying.
And now...

741
01:17:15,136 --> 01:17:16,104
Die!

742
01:17:31,553 --> 01:17:34,355
...Defénde nos
in proélio et colluctatióne,

743
01:17:34,389 --> 01:17:36,658
quae nobis est advérsus

744
01:17:36,691 --> 01:17:38,560
<i>advérsus múndi rectóres

745
01:17:38,593 --> 01:17:40,161
<i>Give me strength o heaven,</i>

746
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:42,297
<i>to guide this soul through
the valley of death</i>

747
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:45,300
<i>and to return him in peace

748
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,135
<i>Let them be turned back
and be confounded</i>

749
01:17:47,168 --> 01:17:48,670
<i>that devise evil against him.</i>

750
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:19,667
Give me strength of heaven,

751
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:22,237
to guide this soul through
the valley of death

752
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:25,073
and to return him in peace
to your loving countenance.

753
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:27,208
Let them be confounded
and ashamed that

754
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:29,577
seek after his soul.

755
01:19:25,868 --> 01:19:26,768
Ina!

756
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:14,649
Ina!

757
01:20:28,496 --> 01:20:29,497
Ina!

758
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:47,883
Seung-Hee...

759
01:20:48,282 --> 01:20:49,751
Are you okay?

760
01:20:49,852 --> 01:20:51,319
Baby.

761
01:20:51,954 --> 01:20:53,154
Ina!

762
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:54,689
Ina!

763
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:58,927
You have to protect Ina.
Always.

764
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:03,932
Seung-Hee, Seung-Hee.

765
01:21:05,266 --> 01:21:06,334
Darling!

766
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:09,337
No! Seung-Hee!

767
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:19,747
Ina!

768
01:21:21,549 --> 01:21:22,885
Ina!

769
01:21:23,618 --> 01:21:25,486
Why are you here?

770
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:38,666
Myung-Jin, I came to get Ina.

771
01:21:38,834 --> 01:21:42,203
Why?
This is what you wanted!

772
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,873
Did you want to get rid of her,
or not?

773
01:21:48,643 --> 01:21:52,513
The Art Camp donation,
how much are we talking about?

774
01:21:52,848 --> 01:21:56,718
In those days,
well, I, I was...

775
01:21:56,819 --> 01:21:59,253
Ina will soon be living
here with us.

776
01:22:05,894 --> 01:22:06,862
Myung-Jin!

777
01:22:07,328 --> 01:22:08,864
Please, let her go!

778
01:22:08,964 --> 01:22:10,698
Please let her
come back with me!

779
01:22:24,712 --> 01:22:25,981
Myung-Jin!

780
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:28,951
I saw what happened.

781
01:22:29,784 --> 01:22:31,753
I saw the closet.

782
01:22:31,854 --> 01:22:37,826
That's why you've brought
those kids here. And Ina.

783
01:22:38,827 --> 01:22:43,798
The last thing you heard on
that terrible day, was your...

784
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:45,533
Stop talking!

785
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,769
This is no life.

786
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:51,405
We're better off
if we're all dead.

787
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:53,508
Do you trust me?

788
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:04,418
Mama!

789
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:07,588
Mama...

790
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:09,657
Mama!

791
01:23:12,995 --> 01:23:15,663
I want to live!

792
01:23:18,133 --> 01:23:21,003
It's us.
We adults are to blame.

793
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:22,905
It's all my fault.

794
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:29,510
It's all my fault.

795
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:31,479
Don't lie to me!

796
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:40,823
Oh my son,

797
01:23:41,056 --> 01:23:43,691
<i>don't forget,
look for your mother!</i>

798
01:23:43,724 --> 01:23:44,927
Mom!

799
01:24:00,075 --> 01:24:02,577
Ina!
Help me!

800
01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:08,349
Kill him.

801
01:24:15,456 --> 01:24:17,792
Ina, don't listen to her!

802
01:24:20,195 --> 01:24:22,797
The Spirits shall live
where they belong,

803
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:25,100
and the Gods
where the Gods reside.

804
01:24:33,075 --> 01:24:34,742
Ina, please!

805
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:47,956
Ina!

806
01:24:48,656 --> 01:24:49,958
<i>Myung-Jin!</i>

807
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:16,617
Here you are, my darling!

808
01:25:18,153 --> 01:25:19,654
Mama?

809
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:22,623
Everything you went through.

810
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,998
You must have been so afraid.

811
01:25:34,202 --> 01:25:36,771
And I couldn't protect you.

812
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:40,474
I'm so sorry, my darling.

813
01:25:43,946 --> 01:25:48,516
Oh, Myung-Jin.
I've been waiting for you.

814
01:25:48,716 --> 01:25:51,186
- Mama...
- Myung-Jin.

815
01:25:56,825 --> 01:25:58,994
Now you can finally rest!

816
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:05,766
Ina.

817
01:26:06,868 --> 01:26:07,936
Ina!

818
01:26:09,171 --> 01:26:10,172
Oh.

819
01:26:14,876 --> 01:26:16,044
Myung-Jin!

820
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:20,182
Mom!

821
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:23,819
Mama!

822
01:26:26,054 --> 01:26:27,189
Oh, Mama!

823
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:35,796
Mama!

824
01:26:37,732 --> 01:26:38,733
Mama!

825
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,707
Ma!

826
01:26:47,775 --> 01:26:48,776
Ma!

827
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:50,145
Mama!

828
01:26:57,853 --> 01:26:59,154
Mama!

829
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:02,090
Mama! Mama!

830
01:27:02,858 --> 01:27:04,026
Ma!

831
01:27:08,363 --> 01:27:09,898
Myung-Jin.

832
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:26,747
Mr. Yeon, hurry up!
We're running out of time!

833
01:27:43,398 --> 01:27:44,966
Myung-Jin.

834
01:27:51,206 --> 01:27:52,941
I am so sorry.

835
01:28:00,282 --> 01:28:02,050
I am so sorry.

836
01:29:27,936 --> 01:29:28,937
Ina!

837
01:29:40,482 --> 01:29:41,850
Ina, wake up!

838
01:29:44,286 --> 01:29:45,420
Ina...

839
01:30:02,837 --> 01:30:04,039
Papa.

840
01:30:06,308 --> 01:30:09,444
Daddy, I want to go home.

841
01:30:10,778 --> 01:30:13,348
Ina, we're going home.
Let's go home.

842
01:30:14,416 --> 01:30:15,749
We're going home.

843
01:31:04,432 --> 01:31:05,533
Mr. Yeon!

844
01:32:31,019 --> 01:32:33,021
She still doesn't remember?

845
01:32:33,121 --> 01:32:35,223
I hope she never will.

846
01:32:37,092 --> 01:32:38,626
How's the new house?

847
01:32:39,494 --> 01:32:42,230
It's big enough for us.
It's cozy.

848
01:32:43,164 --> 01:32:44,332
That's great.

849
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:51,940
If you use your credit card,
I'll have to add on 10 percent.

850
01:32:53,108 --> 01:32:56,111
If you post about me online,
you get a free charm.

<i>Total: $175,000</i>

852
01:33:06,154 --> 01:33:07,389
Well...

853
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:10,125
Ina!

854
01:33:10,992 --> 01:33:11,993
- Bye.
- Bye!

855
01:33:12,026 --> 01:33:13,294
Papa...

856
01:33:13,495 --> 01:33:15,663
- Over here!
- Hop in, young lady!

857
01:33:18,566 --> 01:33:21,102
Don't worry, darling,
he's alright.

858
01:33:23,138 --> 01:33:25,006
Nice try, my friend.

859
01:33:25,206 --> 01:33:26,908
Remove a zero or two.

860
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:42,157
Maybe I'll buy a ball
for my new friend.

861
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:44,426
Oh, stop it!
You don't have any friends!

862
01:33:44,459 --> 01:33:45,427
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

863
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:47,996
<i>Really
Where? Show me.</i>
